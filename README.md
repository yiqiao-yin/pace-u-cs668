# Analytics Capstone Project

## Course Description

The purpose of the Analytics Capstone Project is for students to apply the knowledge and skills acquired during their master's program to a project involving actual data in a real world setting. During the project, students will apply the entire data science process from identifying a problem or opportunity, and collecting and processing actual data to applying suitable and appropriate analytic methods to find a solution.

Both the problem statement for the project and the datasets will come from real-world domains similar to those that students might typically encounter within industry, government, or academic research. The course will culminate with each student making a presentation of his or her work, and submitting a final paper, and, if applicable, a computer application.

This course requires a great deal of self-directed work and the ability to manage time and meet deadlines.

**Restrictions/Requirements:** Open to Data Science Majors.

## Poster and Paper Requirements

As part of the Analytics Capstone Project, students are required to submit a **final paper** and create a **presentation poster** to showcase their work. These deliverables demonstrate your ability to communicate technical findings effectively.

### Writing Platform: Overleaf (LaTeX)

We strongly recommend using **[Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/)** for writing your paper and creating your poster. Overleaf is a collaborative, cloud-based LaTeX editor that:

- Provides professional-quality typesetting for academic papers
- Offers numerous templates for research papers and posters
- Supports real-time collaboration with advisors and team members
- Requires no local LaTeX installation
- Handles references and citations automatically with BibTeX

This playlist covers everything from LaTeX basics to advanced formatting, including:
- Document structure and formatting
- Mathematical equations and symbols
- Tables and figures
- Citations and bibliographies
- Creating professional posters

### Paper Requirements

Your final paper should include:

1. **Abstract**: Brief summary of your project (150-250 words)
2. **Introduction**: Problem statement, motivation, and objectives
3. **Literature Review**: Related work and background research
4. **Methodology**: Data collection, preprocessing, and analytical methods
5. **Results**: Findings with visualizations and statistical analysis
6. **Discussion**: Interpretation of results and implications
7. **Conclusion**: Summary and future work
8. **References**: Properly cited sources

**Recommended Length**: 8-12 pages (excluding references)

### Poster Requirements

Your presentation poster should:

- Summarize your entire project on a single page
- Use clear visualizations and minimal text
- Follow a logical flow: Introduction → Methods → Results → Conclusions
- Be readable from 3-4 feet away
- Include your name, project title, and institutional affiliation

**Recommended Size**: Standard academic poster size (36" × 48" or A0)

### Useful Overleaf Templates

- **Papers**: Search for "IEEE Conference Paper" or "Academic Journal Article" templates
- **Posters**: Search for "Academic Poster" or "Conference Poster" templates

### Submission Guidelines

- Submit your paper as a **PDF** exported from Overleaf
- Submit your poster as a **PDF** suitable for printing
- Include all source code and data files in a supplementary archive
- Ensure all figures and tables are properly captioned and referenced

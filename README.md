# Analytics Capstone Project

## Course Description

The purpose of the Analytics Capstone Project is for students to apply the knowledge and skills acquired during their master's program to a project involving actual data in a real world setting. During the project, students will apply the entire data science process from identifying a problem or opportunity, and collecting and processing actual data to applying suitable and appropriate analytic methods to find a solution.

Both the problem statement for the project and the datasets will come from real-world domains similar to those that students might typically encounter within industry, government, or academic research. The course will culminate with each student making a presentation of his or her work, and submitting a final paper, and, if applicable, a computer application.

This course requires a great deal of self-directed work and the ability to manage time and meet deadlines.

**Restrictions/Requirements:** Open to Data Science Majors.

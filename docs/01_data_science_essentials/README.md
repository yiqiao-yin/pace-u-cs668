- Probability distributions
- Hypothesis testing
- Statistical inference

### 3. Data Preprocessing
- Data cleaning and handling missing values
- Feature scaling and normalization
- Feature engineering techniques
- Handling categorical variables

### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Understanding data distributions
- Identifying patterns and correlations
- Outlier detection
- Visual analysis techniques

### 5. Machine Learning Basics
- Supervised vs. unsupervised learning
- Training, validation, and test sets
- Model evaluation metrics

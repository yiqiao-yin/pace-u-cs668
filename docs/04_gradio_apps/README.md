# Gradio Applications

## Overview

This module teaches students how to build interactive web applications for machine learning models using Gradio. Students will learn to create user-friendly interfaces that make their models accessible to non-technical users.

## Key Topics

### 1. Introduction to Gradio
- What is Gradio?
- Installation and setup
- Basic interface components
- Launching your first app

### 2. Input and Output Components
- Text inputs and outputs
- Image processing
- Audio and video interfaces
- File uploads
- Dataframe interfaces

### 3. Building ML Model Interfaces
- Connecting models to interfaces
- Image classification demos
- Text generation interfaces
- Object detection visualizations
- Multi-modal applications

### 4. Advanced Features
- Custom CSS styling
- Multiple inputs and outputs
- Flagging and feedback collection
- Authentication and access control
- API endpoints

### 5. Deployment
- Sharing apps via Gradio links
- Deploying to Hugging Face Spaces
- Self-hosting considerations
- Performance optimization

## Prerequisites

- Python programming
- Basic understanding of web concepts
